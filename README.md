# PSTModernizer

PSTModernizer carefully applies patches to UIKit and related Apple frameworks to fix known radars with the least impact.
The current set of patches just applies to iOS 9 and nothing is executed on iOS 10, as the bugs have been fixed there.

This project later on might also patch-add a few essential missing elements in iOS 10 if there's need - currently the focus is just to fix various bugs.

## Installation

Simply copy `PSTModernizer.h/mm` into your project, then call `[PSTModernizer installModernizer];` somewhere early, ideally in your app delegate.

Currently covers following radars (all of them have been fixed in iOS 10)

* [26954460 - UIImage creation has a race conditon on background threads.](https://openradar.appspot.com/26954460)<br>
  The radar is actually for fixing the documentation, [the original issue is explained here.](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2016/investigating-thread-saftey-of-UIImage/)
* [26295020 - Action sheets presented for links/numbers donâ€™t work in presented view controllers](https://openradar.appspot.com/26295020)

You can simply delete the workarounds that do not affect you - every workaround is self-contained and can be individually removed.

## FAQ

Q: *Why?*<br>
A: Because we need to support older UIKit versions. [At PSPDFKit we support n-1](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/announcements/version-support/), so we're just about to drop iOS 8 and will likely use something like this for our next major release. This project should make it easier to patch up the system so you need to write less ugly code.

Q: *Isn't that partly using private API?*<br>
A: Partly. The goal is to write workarounds using just public API, but it's not always possible or would lead to much more scary code. If we revert to private API, we use it for good, not evil. You decide. Since we restrict API usage to versions that have been already released and don't apply it to unknown versions, the risk is minimal. If you do find a way to patch things without private API that are similary effective and not 10x the code, please submit a pull request. We also only use it to work around bugs, not for accessing new features. Of course I can't make any guarantees if Apple accepts this on app review. (but so far we have not gotten a report that blocks this, and worst case you disable the parts that are private and just have a slightly more broken app.)
